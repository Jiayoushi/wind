This package contains the classes that represent the commands that the NanoSQL
database recognizes.  All of the commands are represented as subclasses of the
{@link Command} abstract base-class.  Commands are
grouped into the following categories:

<h3>Data Definition Language (DDL) Commands</h3>

These commands manipulate the contents of the data-dictionary.  The supported
commands are as follows:
<ul>
  <li><tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> - {@link CreateTableCommand} class</li>
  <li><tt>DROP TABLE</tt> - {@link DropTableCommand} class</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Manipulation Language (DML) Commands</h3>

These commands retrieve and modify the database tables themselves.  Note that
these commands all derive from the {@link QueryCommand}
abstract class.  The supported commands are as follows:
<ul>
  <li><tt>DELETE ...</tt> - {@link DeleteCommand} class</li>
  <li><tt>INSERT ...</tt> - {@link InsertCommand} class</li>
  <li><tt>SELECT ...</tt> - {@link SelectCommand} class</li>
  <li><tt>UPDATE ...</tt> - {@link UpdateCommand} class</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transaction-Demarcation Commands</h3>

These commands provide control over when a transaction is started or ended:
<ul>
    <li><tt>BEGIN [WORK]</tt> | <tt>START TRANSACTION</tt> - {@link BeginTransactionCommand} class</li>
    <li><tt>COMMIT [WORK]</tt> - {@link CommitTransactionCommand} class</li>
    <li><tt>ROLLBACK [WORK]</tt> - {@link RollbackTransactionCommand} class</li>
</ul>

<h3>Utility Commands</h3>

These commands perform various utility operations:
<ul>
  <li><tt>ANALYZE ...</tt> - {@link AnalyzeCommand} class</li>
  <li><tt>EXPLAIN ...</tt> - {@link ExplainCommand} class</li>
  <li><tt>EXIT</tt> | <tt>QUIT</tt> - {@link ExitCommand} class</li>
</ul>
